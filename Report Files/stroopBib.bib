abstract = {A consistent finding in the Stroop literature is that congruency effects (i.e., the color-naming latency difference between words presented in incongruent vs. congruent colors) are larger for mostly-congruent items (e.g., the word RED presented most often in red) than for mostly-incongruent items (e.g., the word GREEN presented most often in yellow). This "item-specific proportion-congruent effect" might be produced by a conflict-adaptation process (e.g., fully focus attention to the color when the word GREEN appears) and/or by a more general learning mechanism of stimulus-response contingencies (e.g., respond "yellow" when the word GREEN appears). Under the assumption that limited-capacity resources are necessary for learning stimulus-response contingencies, we examined the contingency-learning account using both Stroop and nonconflict (i.e., noncolor words written in colors) versions of a color identification task while participants maintained a working memory (WM) load. Consistent with the contingency-learning account, WM load modulated people's ability to learn contingencies in the nonconflict task. In contrast, across 3 experiments, WM load did not affect the item-specific proportion-congruent effect in the Stroop task even though we employed a design (the "2-item set" design) in which contingency learning should be the dominant process. These results imply that the item-specific proportion-congruent effect is not merely a byproduct of contingency learning but a manifestation of reactive control, a mode of control engagement that may be especially useful when WM resources are scarce.},

abstract = {Responding to a conflict is assumed to trigger attentional-control processes-that is, processes that enable us to activate goal-relevant information and to inhibit irrelevant information. Typically, conflict is induced in tasks, such as the Stroop task (which requires identifying the color of color words) or the flanker task (which requires identifying a central character among flankers). Combining the conflicts within the same trial has been found to result in an interaction in reaction times (RTs), suggesting a generalization of attentional control. However, this interaction was observed when the congruency effect was substantial-that is, when the RT difference between incongruent trials (e.g., the word green printed in red for the Stroop task) and congruent trials (e.g., the word red printed in red) was large. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether a large congruency effect is the necessary condition for observing the interaction. To this end, Stroop and flanker tasks were combined, and participants were asked to respond to the color of the central letter/word while ignoring the flanking letters/words. The magnitude of the congruency effect was increased: (a) by testing older adults (Experiment 1), (b) by manipulating the proportion of trials in which participants were asked to respond to the word meaning (Experiment 2), and (c) by using vocal responses (Experiment 3). The results showed an interaction when the Stroop congruency effect was large. Therefore, such interactions can be used to validate or invalidate theoretical explanations only when the precondition-a},

abstract = {A robust finding in the Stroop literature is that congruency effects (i.e., the color-naming latency difference between color words presented in incongruent vs. congruent colors) are larger for color words presented most often in their congruent color than for color words presented most often in incongruent colors. However, the cause of this item-specific proportion congruent (ISPC) effect is unclear, as it might be produced by either a conflict-adaptation strategy (e.g., prepare for conflict when the word RED appears) and/or a more general learning mechanism of stimulus-response contingencies (e.g., prepare to respond blue when the word RED appears). Thus far, attempts to directly dissociate the two processes appear to indicate no role for conflict adaptation, at least in situations in which contingency learning is also possible. We re-examined this conclusion in a Stroop task in which contingency learning and item-specific conflict frequency were manipulated partially independently. In addition to a contingency-learning effect emerging for stimuli matched on conflict frequency, a conflict-adaptation effect also emerged for stimuli matched on contingency. The two effects also had different time courses, with the contingency-learning effect emerging early and remaining stable throughout the experiment and the conflict-adaptation effect arising later in the experiment. These results challenge not only the contingency-learning account of the ISPC effect, an account that denies the existence of a conflict-adaptation process, but also control accounts that assume that, although conflict-adaptation processes do exist, they are not used when contingency learning is also possible.},
